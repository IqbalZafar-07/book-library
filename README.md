--> I have tried to clone the given sample of this website

--> It have mainly three component Header, LeftSide, RightSide

--> Right side again contains two component GridView and ListView which renders conditionally when
user try to toggle between views

--> there are two more file named FetchData and MockData

--> In Fetch Data I have written the code to fetch data from API using axios and fetch method

--> In MockData I have store the mockData as I did not find any API for the same

--> The Feature of this App is :-

    1. user can toggle view between gridView and listView using Icon which is present in Header

    2. user can toggle light and dark theme using Icon which is present in leftSide Component

    3. user can filter books using input box present at the top and to work this component          efficiently I have used the concept of Debouncing.

    4. It is mobile responsive to do so I have use @media querry of css which will apply on device having width less than 625px
